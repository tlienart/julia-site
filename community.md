# Community Standards

Please take a moment to read the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/). We expect that your participation in any Julia related forum, online or offline, respects these standards.

\\

## Diversity and Inclusion

The Julia Community is committed to continuing to foster an inclusive and diverse culture. Read more about how we are doing this on our [diversity page](https://julialang.org/diversity).

## 2019 Julia User and Developer Survey

We conducted the first annual Julia User & Developer Survey in June 2019, and [presented the results at JuliaCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx6lBSHqGfc). Download the [survey findings](https://julialang.org/images/2019-julia-user-developer-survey.pdf).

## Official Channels

### GitHub

We use GitHub for the development of Julia itself. There we host our source code, track [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues), and accept [pull requests](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulls). We use the issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests, and proposed changes. For support and questions, please use Discourse.

### Discourse

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/). Discourse is the right place to do any of the following:

@@tight-list
* **Keep up to date** on important Julia announcements like language releases and JuliaCon.
* **Ask a question** about any aspect of using or developing Julia or its associated packages and tools. The Discourse forum is the best place to get a fast, high-quality answer to your Julia question. There are subcategories for various Julia application domains such as machine learning, finance, visualisation and GPUs. Questions from newcomers are always welcome: you can use the “first steps” tag to highlight your question as one that would benefit other new users.
* **Respond to others’ questions**: our community thrives when people share their knowledge and experience.
* **Announce a new package** or solicit feedback about something you have been developing.
* **Advertise** Julia-related jobs and community events.

For Chinese users a Simplified Chinese version discourse is also hosted by the community. Please click this [Julia中文论坛](https://discourse.juliacn.com/) link.

The Discourse forum replaced the Julia mailing lists, the largest of which were [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-users) and [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-dev), at the end of 2016. Those lists are now read-only but you may like to search them to see if your question has already been raised.

### Chat

For casual conversation and quick, informal questions, we have an [official Julia Slack](https://julialang.slack.com/). Slack is also a good place to start if you think you need help but aren’t quite sure what you should be asking or where to ask it. To join, please visit [slackinvite.julialang.org](https://slackinvite.julialang.org/) to agree to the community code of conduct and receive an invitation.

The JuliaCN community has a QQ group: 316628299

### YouTube

All the [JuliaCon](http://juliacon.org/) videos and other videos of general interest in the community are uploaded to the [Julia Language YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage).

\\

## Other channels

On Twitter, tweet with the [#julialang](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23julialang) hashtag.

Julia also has a presence on Stack Overflow under the [julia](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/julia) tag, and on Stack Overflow en Español under [julia](http://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia).

For those who prefer IRC to our official forums, there is a [#julia channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia) on Freenode. We also have an unofficial [Gitter](https://gitter.im/JuliaLang/julia) channel. There is a small [Julia subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/) for casual discussion.

## International Community

The Julia community is global, with meetups all over the world and resources in a variety of different languages.

### Localization

Julia’s official documentation is in English, but many groups work to translate and localize documentation and other resources. A few such groups that are leading these efforts include:

* [JuliaTokyo](http://julia.tokyo/) (Japanese)
* [JuliaCN](http://cn.julialang.org/) (Chinese)
