However, TPUs are not able to execute arbitrary code and thus often require individual attention to fix new patterns in XLA.jl or other packages. Additionally, the performance characteristics of the TPU hardware are quite unlike that of CPU or even GPU and models may thus require TPU-specific adjustments to achieve peak performance. Lastly, the speed of TPUs presents signficant challenges to data input pipelines even at single-TPU levels of performance. Having a wide set of models available that are tuned for TPU will aid in finding common abstractions for models independent of hardware.</p> <p>Mentors: <a href="https://github.com/Keno">Keno Fischer</a></p> <h3 id=benchmarks ><a href="#benchmarks">Benchmarks</a></h3> <p>A benchmark suite would help us to keep Julia&#39;s performance for ML models in shape, as well as revealing opportunities for improvement. Like the model-zoo project, this would involve contributing standard models that exercise common ML use case &#40;images, text etc&#41; and profiling them. The project could extend to include improving performance where possible, or creating a &quot;benchmarking CI&quot; like Julia&#39;s own <a href="https://github.com/JuliaCI/Nanosoldier.jl">nanosoldier</a>.</p> <p>Mentors: <a href="https://github.com/dhairyagandhi96/">Dhairya Gandhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/staticfloat">Elliot Saba</a>.</p> <h3 id=multi-gpu_training ><a href="#multi-gpu_training">Multi-GPU training</a></h3> <p>Implement and demonstrate multi-GPU parallelism.

A suite of tools in Julia to enable research in this area would be useful. This is a large, complex project that is suited for someone with an interest in music and machine learning. This project will need a mechanism to read music files &#40;primarily MIDI&#41;, a way to synthesise sounds, and finally a model to learn composition. All of this is admittedly a lot of work, so the exact boundaries of the project can be flexible, but this can be an exciting project if you are interested in both music and machine learning.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Music notation, some basic music theory, MIDI format, Transformer and LSTM architectures</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong>: <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer">Music Transformer</a>, <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/maestro-wave2midi2wave">Wave2MIDI2Wave</a></p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/aviks/">Avik Sengupta</a></p> <h3 id=neural_networks_for_solving_differential_equations ><a href="#neural_networks_for_solving_differential_equations">Neural networks for solving differential equations</a></h3> <p>Neural networks can be used as a method for efficiently solving difficult partial differential equations.

For example, evaluating <code>f</code> may require solving a PDE or other applications of complex linear algebra. Thus, instead of always directly evaluating <code>f</code>, one can develop a surrogate model <code>g</code> which is approximately <code>f</code> by training on previous data collected from <code>f</code> evaluations. This technique of using a trained surrogate in place of the real function is called surrogate optimization and mixes techniques from machine learning to accelerate optimization.</p> <p>Advanced techniques <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-numerica/article/kernel-techniques-from-machine-learning-to-meshless-methods/00686923110F799A1537C4F02BBAAE8E">utilize radial basis functions</a> and Gaussian processes in order to interpolate to new parameters to estimate <code>f</code> in areas which have not been sampled. <a href="http&#37;3A&#37;2F&#37;2Fwww.ressources-actuarielles.net&#37;2FEXT&#37;2FISFA&#37;2F1226.nsf&#37;2F9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6&#37;2Fe7dc33e4da12c5a9c12576d8002e442b&#37;2F&#37;24FILE&#37;2FJones01.pdf">Adaptive training techniques</a> explore how to pick new areas to evaluate <code>f</code> to better hone in on global optima.

These models are generally differential equations given by physical first principles, where the constants in the equations such as chemical reaction rates and planetary masses determine the overall dynamics. The inverse problem to simulation, known as parameter estimation, is the process of utilizing data to determine these model parameters.</p> <p>The purpose of this project is to utilize the growing array of statistical, optimization, and machine learning tools in the Julia ecosystem to build library functions that make it easy for scientists to perform this parameter estimation with the most high-powered and robust methodologies. Possible projects include improving methods for Bayesian estimation of parameters via Stan.jl and Julia-based libraries like Turing.jl, or global optimization-based approaches. Novel techniques like classifying model outcomes via support vector machines and deep neural networks is can also be considered. Research and benchmarking to attempt to find the most robust methods will take place in this project. Additionally, the implementation of methods for estimating structure, such as <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/52/18507">topological sensitivity analysis</a> along with performance enhancements to existing methods will be considered.</p> <p>Some work in this area can be found in <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqParamEstim.jl">DiffEqParamEstim.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqBayes.jl">DiffEqBayes.jl</a>. Examples can be found <a href="http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/analysis/parameter_estimation.html">in the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation</a>.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Background knowledge of standard machine learning, statistical, or optimization techniques. It&#39;s recommended but not required that one has basic knowledge of differential equations and DifferentialEquations.jl. Using the differential equation solver to get outputs from parameters can be learned on the job, but you should already be familiar &#40;but not necessarily an expert&#41; with the estimation techniques you are looking to employ.</p> <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Library functions for performing parameter estimation and inferring properties of differential equation solutions from parameters. Notebooks containing benchmarks determining the effectiveness of various methods and classifying when specific approaches are appropriate will be developed simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas">Chris Rackauckas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Vaibhavdixit02">Vaibhav Dixit</a></p> <h2 id=integration_of_fenicsjl_with_dolfin-adjoint_zygotejl_for_scientific_machine_learning ><a href="#integration_of_fenicsjl_with_dolfin-adjoint_zygotejl_for_scientific_machine_learning">Integration of FEniCS.jl with dolfin-adjoint &#43; Zygote.jl for Scientific Machine Learning</a></h2> <p>Scientific machine learning requires mixing scientific computing libraries with machine learning. <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/the-essential-tools-of-scientific-machine-learning-scientific-ml/">This blog post highlights how the tooling of Julia is fairly advanced in this field</a> compared to alternatives such as Python, but one area that has not been completely worked out is integration of automatic differentiation with partial differential equations. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/FEniCS.jl">FEniCS.jl</a> is a wrapper to the <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCS</a> project for finite element solutions of partial differential equations.
