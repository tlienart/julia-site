Recently this strategy has been dubbed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125">physics-informed neural networks</a> and has seen a resurgence because of its efficiency advantages over classical deep learning. Efficient implementations from recent papers are being explored as part of the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/NeuralNetDiffEq.jl">NeuralNetDiffEq.jl</a> package. The <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/NeuralNetDiffEq.jl/issues">issue tracker</a> contains links to papers which would be interesting new neural network based methods to implement and benchmark against classical techniques.

For example, evaluating <code>f</code> may require solving a PDE or other applications of complex linear algebra. Thus, instead of always directly evaluating <code>f</code>, one can develop a surrogate model <code>g</code> which is approximately <code>f</code> by training on previous data collected from <code>f</code> evaluations. This technique of using a trained surrogate in place of the real function is called surrogate optimization and mixes techniques from machine learning to accelerate optimization.</p> <p>Advanced techniques <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-numerica/article/kernel-techniques-from-machine-learning-to-meshless-methods/00686923110F799A1537C4F02BBAAE8E">utilize radial basis functions</a> and Gaussian processes in order to interpolate to new parameters to estimate <code>f</code> in areas which have not been sampled. <a href="http&#37;3A&#37;2F&#37;2Fwww.ressources-actuarielles.net&#37;2FEXT&#37;2FISFA&#37;2F1226.nsf&#37;2F9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6&#37;2Fe7dc33e4da12c5a9c12576d8002e442b&#37;2F&#37;24FILE&#37;2FJones01.pdf">Adaptive training techniques</a> explore how to pick new areas to evaluate <code>f</code> to better hone in on global optima.

Strong knowledge of numerical analysis is helpful but not required.</p> <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Library functions for performing surrogate optimization with tests on differential equation models.</p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas">Chris Rackauckas</a></p> <h3 id=parameter_estimation_for_nonlinear_dynamical_models ><a href="#parameter_estimation_for_nonlinear_dynamical_models">Parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamical models</a></h3> <p>Machine learning has become a popular tool for understanding data, but scientists typically understand the world through the lens of physical laws and their resulting dynamical models. These models are generally differential equations given by physical first principles, where the constants in the equations such as chemical reaction rates and planetary masses determine the overall dynamics. The inverse problem to simulation, known as parameter estimation, is the process of utilizing data to determine these model parameters.</p> <p>The purpose of this project is to utilize the growing array of statistical, optimization, and machine learning tools in the Julia ecosystem to build library functions that make it easy for scientists to perform this parameter estimation with the most high-powered and robust methodologies. Possible projects include improving methods for Bayesian estimation of parameters via Stan.jl and Julia-based libraries like Turing.jl, or global optimization-based approaches. Novel techniques like classifying model outcomes via support vector machines and deep neural networks is can also be considered. Research and benchmarking to attempt to find the most robust methods will take place in this project. Additionally, the implementation of methods for estimating structure, such as <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/52/18507">topological sensitivity analysis</a> along with performance enhancements to existing methods will be considered.</p> <p>Some work in this area can be found in <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqParamEstim.jl">DiffEqParamEstim.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqBayes.jl">DiffEqBayes.jl</a>. Examples can be found <a href="http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/analysis/parameter_estimation.html">in the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation</a>.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Background knowledge of standard machine learning, statistical, or optimization techniques. It&#39;s recommended but not required that one has basic knowledge of differential equations and DifferentialEquations.jl. Using the differential equation solver to get outputs from parameters can be learned on the job, but you should already be familiar &#40;but not necessarily an expert&#41; with the estimation techniques you are looking to employ.</p> <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Library functions for performing parameter estimation and inferring properties of differential equation solutions from parameters. Notebooks containing benchmarks determining the effectiveness of various methods and classifying when specific approaches are appropriate will be developed simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas">Chris Rackauckas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Vaibhavdixit02">Vaibhav Dixit</a></p> <h2 id=integration_of_fenicsjl_with_dolfin-adjoint_zygotejl_for_scientific_machine_learning ><a href="#integration_of_fenicsjl_with_dolfin-adjoint_zygotejl_for_scientific_machine_learning">Integration of FEniCS.jl with dolfin-adjoint &#43; Zygote.jl for Scientific Machine Learning</a></h2> <p>Scientific machine learning requires mixing scientific computing libraries with machine learning. <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/the-essential-tools-of-scientific-machine-learning-scientific-ml/">This blog post highlights how the tooling of Julia is fairly advanced in this field</a> compared to alternatives such as Python, but one area that has not been completely worked out is integration of automatic differentiation with partial differential equations. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/FEniCS.jl">FEniCS.jl</a> is a wrapper to the <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCS</a> project for finite element solutions of partial differential equations. We would like to augment the Julia wrappers to allow for integration with Julia&#39;s automatic differentiation libraries like <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">Zygote.jl</a> by using <a href="http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/release/">dolfin-adjoint</a>.
