There are two forms of identifiability analysis: structural and practical. Structural identifiability analysis relates changes in the solution of the ODE directly to other parameters, showcasing that it is impossible to distinguish between parameter A being higher and parameter B being lower, or the vice versa situation, given only data about the solution because of how the two interact. This could be done directly on the symbolic form of the equation as part of <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a>. Meanwhile, practical identifiability analysis looks as to whether the parameters are non-identifiable in a practical sense, for example if two parameters are numerically indistinguishable &#40;given possibly noisy data&#41;. In this case, numerical techniques being built in DiffEqSensitivity.jl, such as a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqSensitivity.jl/issues/109">nonlinear likelihood profiler</a> or an <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqSensitivity.jl/issues/108">information sensitivity measure</a> can be used to showcase whether a parameter has a unique enough effect to be determined.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: A basic background in differential equations and the ability to use numerical ODE solver libraries.
