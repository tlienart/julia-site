# Diversity

As a [NumFocus supported project](https://numfocus.org), we abide by their [Code of Conduct and Diversity Statment](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct):  

> NumFOCUS welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people of all backgrounds and identities. We are committed to promoting and sustaining a culture that values mutual respect, tolerance, and learning, and we work together as a community to help each other live out these values.
> We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community is stronger, more vibrant, and produces better software and better science. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors, more sources for ideas, and fewer shared assumptions that might hinder development or research.
> Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific identities that are impacted by systemic discrimination and marginalization. We welcome all people to participate in the NumFOCUS community regardless of their identity or background.

We believe that maintaining and promoting diversity and inclusion is the only way we can have a strong and vibrant community. We have and will countinue to make significant investments in making sure that we relentlessly push towards that goal.

Below you will find a breakdown of our past and current diversity and inclusion initatives. If you have any ideas, feedback, or the like, feel free to send and email to `diversity@julialang.org` or drop by the [#diversity channel on Slack](https://slackinvite.julialang.org).
